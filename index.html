                  <p>So far the CS6 installers do not run in the macOS Sierra GM. I went for a clean install this time because I could no longer fathom the stench of Dropbox upon my system. So here is a quick and easy way to get the CS6 installers running again:</p>
                  <p><code>
                     $ cd /Volumes/CS6\ ProdPrm/Adobe\ CS6\ Production\ Premium/Install.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
                     $ ./Install<br />

                  <h3>Pindown</h3>
                  <div class="post-metadata">
                     <p>November 19 2015</p>
                  </div>
               </header>
               <section class="post-content">
                  <p>I write here infrequently but I'm regularly posting links to things I find either interesting or memorable. I somehow never got used to bookmarks in the browser, so this is the closest I have to something searchable. I recently started using Pinboard.in to save links so that I could read and review them later. Manually copying my saved links from Pinboard to the site generator (Pelican) was a little tedious, and running it through IFTTT was very rough, so I decided to teach myself some Python and come up with my own fix.</p>
                  <p>The result is Pindown and I've tried to make it as general purpose as possible.</p>
                  <p>I use it like this:</p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>Save a link to Pinboard either from my phone or using their bookmarklet.
                     <li>Have a cronjob running Pindown every 5 minutes looking for any new links.
                     <li>Pindown saves any new links to individual Markdown files in my drafts folder, using a customisable Jinja template. I have my template set up to put the supplied link description in as a blockquote, because that's usually how I will post links here.
                     <li>I can then review my drafts folder, deleting the links I don't like, and cleaning up and publishing those that I do.
                  </ol>
                  <p>It's not perfect and it's very niche, but it is useable and I find it useful.</p>
